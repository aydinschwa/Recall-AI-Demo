# Podcast Assistant Bot Demo - Recall.ai

This is a sample app that demonstrates how to create a podcast assistant bot using [Recall.ai](https://recall.ai), [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com), and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). It's deliberately designed to be simple and easy to understand while still being powerful enough to be interesting.  

The app deploys a Google Meet bot that transcribes any speech occurring in the meeting in real time. It uses OpenAI's GPT to determine whether you're asking it a question, and should respond to any variation of "Hey Jamie, pull up that video about x". It will then search Youtube for the videos you're asking for and will send links to them in the chat.
